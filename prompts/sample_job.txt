At .txt, our mission is to help AI speak the language of every application.

.txt's provides high performance regular expression and context-free grammar (CFG) structured generation though C, C++, Python, and Rust libraries.

We are the authors of outlines and outlines-core, both leading open source libraries (+10k ‚≠êÔ∏è) for structured generation. In 2024, we raised $11.9 million which is fueling the efforts of our global, fully remote team to create software that goes beyond simple conversation.

Project Leadership: Initiate and drive the development of mission-critical Rust projects from conception through deployment.

Performance Engineering: Write and optimize parsing code with a strong emphasis on performance, supported by automated benchmarking.

Data Structures & Algorithms: Ability to debug grammars and design and implement efficient data structures for automata, finite-state machines, and text-based indexing/search.

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work with other teams to build production ready Rust components.

Tooling & CI/CD: Utilize advanced profiling, debugging, and continuous integration tools to maintain and enhance code quality.

About You 
Proven Rust Experience: Demonstrated ability to lead and contribute to non-trivial, collaborative Rust projects.

Professional Development: A track record in developing well-tested, high-performance software.

Tooling Expertise: Expertise with code profiling and debugging. Experience automated workflows in CI.

Multilanguage Proficiency: Ability to learn/work with the following technologies: CUDA, C, C++, Rust/Python bindings.

Collaborative Mindset: Excellent communication skills and a proactive approach, ideally suited for an early-stage startup culture.

Why You Should Join Us:
üöÄ Cutting-edge technology

Structured generation is still a nascent technology. Innovation is not the exception, it‚Äôs the rule.

‚öñÔ∏è Work-life balance

We don‚Äôt expect you to spend 80 hours per week at your desk, and we won‚Äôt either. We have lives outside of work, and want you too as well. Sometimes we will all need to be all-in, but it will be the exception rather than the norm.

üåê Remote first

Work from anywhere in the world. We value both written communication and regular, real-time communication (especially Slack huddles and how they encourage organic, real-time collaboration).

üí∏ Competitive compensation and benefits

We pay market rate (adjusting for seed-stage startup) + equity options, offer health, dental, and vision insurance, and have a 401k (US Only). We‚Äôll get you a GPU if you don‚Äôt have one already.

Location
.txt is a fully remote company with the majority of the team in the US and EU.

To facilitate real-time collaboration, we require team members to be available, on a daily basis, for at least 3 hours of overlap with morning New York City (Eastern Time Zone) business hours, 8am - 1pm.

Applying
Please provide a 1-page resume in English.

Kindly, do not apply to more than one position at a time.
